    <h2>Validating GS1 Data Credentials</h2>
    <p>This section describes the philosophy and procedures to validate GS1 Data Credentials.</p>
    <section id="data-validation-whatis">
        <h3>What is Data Validation</h3>
        <p>GS1 Data Credential validation is the process of validating a set of data about a GS1 ID Key.</p>

        <p>For example, a GS1 Data Credential about a GS1 Digital Link describing a GTIN might assert master data about the product
        such as dimensions, color, sizing, description, country of origin or any other attribute.  In this case,
        it's desirable to verify that this data has not been altered and was created by the licensee of that specific GTIN.</p>

        <p>Another data credential might offer details about a specific shipment (SSCC), including the date,
            time, and location the shipment was received by a specific party. In this case, it's important
            to verify that this data was unaltered, but it is unlikely this would be issued by the licensee
            of the SSCC.</p>

        <h3>Data Validation Overview</h3>
        <p>Validating a data credential without a <code>keyAuthorization</code> property is simply ensuring
        that the credential is well-formed and has not been altered.  When a data credential contains
        a  <code>keyAuthorization</code>, its best practice to validate the chain of credentials
        linked via this authorization. An example of this credential chain is shown in the image below:</p>

        </figure>

        <p>This example shows a GS1 Product Data Credential that asserts product facts from the brand owner.
            Because the <code>keyAuthorization</code> that links back to a GS1 ID Key Credential which then
            extends a valid GS1 License chain, the verifier can have confidence that this product data
            originated from the licensee of the GS1 ID Key.  </p>

        <h3>Data Validation Rules</h3>

        Denoting the GS1 ID Data Credential as <strong>D</strong>,
        the following steps MUST be performed to validate a GS1 Data Credential

        <ul>
            <li><strong>D</strong> MUST be a valid VCDM 2.0 credential document.</li>
            <li>The signature of <strong>D</strong> MUST be valid and from a signing key referenced in the issuer DID.</li>
            <li><strong>D</strong> MUST NOT be revoked (see <a href="#revocation"></a>).</li>
            <li><strong>D</strong> <code>validFrom</code> MUST NOT be in the future.</li>
            <li>The credential document <strong>D</strong>  MUST conform to the JSON schema for the data credential:
                <ul>
                    <li>For general data credentials  <a href="https://id.gs1.org/vc/schema/v1/data">https://id.gs1.org/vc/schema/v1/data</a></li>
                    <li>For product data credentials  <a href="https://id.gs1.org/vc/schema/v1/productdata">https://id.gs1.org/vc/schema/v1/productdata</a></li>
                    <li>For organization data credentials  <a href="https://id.gs1.org/vc/schema/v1/organizationdata">https://id.gs1.org/vc/schema/v1/organizationdata</a></li>
                    <li>For custom data credentials, any additional schemas defined within the credential</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        If the credential <strong>D</strong> contains a <code>keyAuthorization</code> property, denoting the credential referenced by this property as <strong>K</strong>, it's possible to verify that the data in this credential was created by the licensee of the GS1 ID Key.  The following steps SHOULD be performed:

        <ul>
            <li>The <code>issuer</code> of <strong>D</strong>  MUST match the issuer of <strong>K</strong></li>
            <li><strong>K</strong> MUST be a valid <a href="#key-validation-rules">GS1 ID Key Credential</a></li>
            <li>The canonicalized <strong>D</strong> <code>credentialSubject</code> <code>id</code> MUST start with
                and MAY extend the canonicalized <strong>K</strong> <code>credentialSubject</code> <code>id</code></li>
        </ul>
