    <h2>Validating GS1 License Credentials</h2>
    <p>GS1 License Credential validation is the process of confirming that a specific license is current,
    authentic, and relevant.  Because GS1 Licenses are issued in a federated manner, license
    validation requires examining the set (chain) of licenses back to the GO root of trust.</p>
    <section id="license-validation-philosophy">
        <h3>Philosophy of License Validation</h3>
        <p>GS1 License Credential validation is the process by which a machine can verify that a GS1 License is
        authentic as part of the GS1 identity system. Generally, this involves validating the chain
        of GS1 License Credentials starting with the most specific license up to the root license
        issued by GS1 GO. In addition to checking the fields of the license documents, the documents must
        link together using the <code>extendsCredential</code> property forming a chain back to the root license.
        This chain must have properties so that each <code>licenseValue</code> stems from its previous <code>licenseValue</code>.
        This validation process is presented in detail in the sections below.</p>
        <p> For example, in the chain with prefix license 022, GCP 02234545 and individual GTIN 02234545645654,
        we can see the <code>licenseValue</code> of the GTIN starts with the <code>licenseValue</code> of the GCP which starts with
        the <code>licenseValue</code> from the prefix license, indicating a complete and valid chain.</p>

        <p>Validating a license chain ensures that assertions from the licensee are authentic and attributable to the party identified by the <code>organization</code> within the GS1 License Credential subject field.  For specifics of GS1
        identity validation policies consult the  <p><span class="todo">Governance Document</span> or your local MO.
